Swift/Win32 aims to provide a [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) model for writing applications on Windows.  It provides Swift friendly wrapping of the Win32 APIs much like [MFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Foundation_Class_Library) did for C++.

## Build Requirements

- Swift 5.4 or newer
- Windows SDK 10.0.107763 or newer
- CMake 3.16 or newer

## Building

This project requires Swift 5.4 or newer. You can use the the snapshot binaries from [swift.org](https://swift.org/download/), download the nightly build from [Azure](https://dev.azure.com/compnerd/swift-build), or build the Swift compiler from source.

### Recommended (CMake)

The following example session shows how to build with CMake 3.16 or newer.

```cmd
cmake -B build -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=YES -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_Swift_FLAGS="-sdk %SDKROOT%" -G Ninja -S .
ninja -C build SwiftWin32 UICatalog

%CD%\build\bin\UICatalog.exe
```

Following environment variables should be set/adjusted before run the above commands (the shown paths assume that you use compiler from the official swift installers from [swift.org](https://www.swift.org/download/)).

- Visual Studio compiler toolchain

  The CMake commands use the `mt` tool which requires a Visual Studio compiler environment (Build Tools should be fine too).
  e.g. if you have Visual Studio 2019 installed you can create a command prompt by click on `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2019` from the Visual Studio 2019 installation in the Windows Start Menu.
  
  Newer versions of Visual Studio or the corresponding Build Tools should be fine too.

  Another way of activating a Visual Studio environment is the tool [vswhere](https://github.com/microsoft/vswhere).

- `SDKROOT`

  This should be the path to the Windows Platform SDK from the Swift library. This should be already set by the official swift installer. If not set the env var.

  \>= 5.10 `SDKROOT` needs to be `%LocalAppData%\Programs\Swift\Platforms\Windows.platform\Developer\SDKs\Windows.sdk`

  < 5.10 `SDKROOT` needs to be `%SystemDrive%\Library\Developer\Platforms\Windows.platform\Developer\SDKs\Windows.sdk`

  Examples for < 5.10:

  Command Prompt: `set SDKROOT=%SystemDrive%\Library\Developer\Platforms\Windows.platform\Developer\SDKs\Windows.sdk`

  PowerShell: `$env:SDKROOT="%SystemDrive%\Library\Developer\Platforms\Windows.platform\Developer\SDKs\Windows.sdk"`

- `Path`

  The `Path` environment variables needs to be extended to allow the Swift compiler to be found.
  This is only required when this is not already the case.
  When you type `where swiftc` (`(Get-Command swiftc).Path` for PowerShell) and see no path to `swiftc` the following command is required.

  \>= 5.10 the `Path` needs to extended with `%LocalAppData%\Programs\Swift\Runtimes\5.9.0\usr\bin;%LocalAppData%\Programs\Swift\Toolchains\5.9.0+Asserts\usr\bin`

  < 5.10 the `Path` needs to be extended with `%SystemDrive%\Library\Developer\Toolchains\unknown-Asserts-development.xctoolchain\usr\bin`

  Examples for < 5.10:

  Command Prompt: `set Path=%SystemDrive%\Library\Developer\Toolchains\unknown-Asserts-development.xctoolchain\usr\bin;%Path%`

  PowerShell: `$env:Path="%SystemDrive%\Library\Developer\Toolchains\unknown-Asserts-development.xctoolchain\usr\bin;$env:Path"`



### Swift Package Manager

Building this project with swift-package-manager is supported although CMake is recommended for ease.  The Swift Package Manager based build is required for code completion via SourceKit-LSP.  It also allows for the use of Swift/Win32 in other applications using SPM.  In order to use SPM to build this project additional post-build steps are required to use the demo applications.

The following known limitations are known:

1. It is not possible to deploy auxiliary files which are required for Swift/Win32 based applications to function to the correct location.
2. It is not possible to build and run multiple demo projects as the auxiliary files collide.

```cmd
swift build --product UICatalog
mt -nologo -manifest Examples\UICatalog\UICatalog.exe.manifest -outputresource:.build\x86_64-unknown-windows-msvc\debug\UICatalog.exe
copy Examples\UICatalog\Info.plist .build\x86_64-unknown-windows-msvc\debug\
.build\x86_64-unknown-windows-msvc\debug\UICatalog.exe
```

In order to get access to the manifest tool (`mt`), the build and testing should occur in a [x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/how-to-enable-a-64-bit-visual-cpp-toolset-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-160)

## Testing

The current implementation is still under flux and many of the interfaces we expect to be present are not yet implemented.  Because clearly indicating the missing surface makes it easier to focus on what needs to be accomplished, there are many instances of interfaces being declared but not implemented.  Most of these sites will abort if they are reached.  In order to enable testing for scenarios which may interct with these cases, a special condition has been added as `ENABLE_TESTING` to allow us to bypass the missing functionality.

You can run tests by adding that as a flag when invoking the SPM test command as:

```cmd
swift test -Xswiftc -DENABLE_TESTING
```
